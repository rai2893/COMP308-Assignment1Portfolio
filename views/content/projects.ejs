          <h3>Online Discussion Forum</h3>
          <p>This was a project I worked on in my 6 Months Industrial Training of my Bachelors Degree.
              The project provided the users a platform in which the users can create different 
              topics and discuss them. Users could create their account and upload their pictures.   
              It was created using PHP MySQL(XAMPP).

          <h3>DailyBurn Application</h3>
          <p>This was a project we worked on in the Software Development Project-1.
          This is an Android Fitness App where the user can keep track of his/her fitness regime
          by keeping track of all the workout schedule and diet plan. It also lets the users create
          a customised diet plan based on the calories and nutrition needed. It was created using 
          Android Studio. SQLite database was used.

          <h3>Android GameShop</h3>
          <p> We are working on this project in Software Development Project-2 right now.
              This application lets the users buy/sell their games. Also, it lets the users 
              rate different games.
